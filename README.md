# mRNA-protein-analysis
This project focuses on developing a model or algorithm to efficiently identify and classify proteins based on mRNA sequences from various organisms. By leveraging advanced data science techniques, we aim to create a system that can predict the proteins synthesized from these mRNA sequences with high accuracy.
